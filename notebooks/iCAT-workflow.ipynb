A \"stack\" is a key concept within the `render-ws` + CATMAID ecosystem that will be expanded upon later. But basically, a stack can be thought of a collection of **one or more** *images* at **one or more** *layers in z* from **one** *imaging channel*. Hence, all of the small EM tiles will belong to one stack as will the large EM tiles, as will each fluorescence channel. It is perhaps easiest to grasp this organization scheme by looking at the directory tree of the sample data (`iCAT-workflow/iCAT_sample_data`)\n",

Now we will export our rendered images to tiles that can be reimported to CATMAID. Not ideal, I know. We are currently working on supporting \"dynamic rendering\" between `render` and CATMAID. But this is what we have to do for the time being.\n",

There is no `render-python` wrapper for the export function (to my knowledge), but we can make a direct call to the shell script (`render_catmaid_boxes.sh`) that does this automatically. We first suppply the script with the necessary arguments and then execute for each stack."
